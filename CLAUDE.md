# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude (and other agents) working in this repository.

## What this repo is

A pnpm workspace monorepo. Tooling (Node, pnpm, and future compilers) is
pinned and managed by [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev). The target language and
framework is [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org).

- `packages/*` — workspace packages.
- `mise.toml` — pinned tools (`[tools]`) and the task interface (`[tasks.*]`).
- `.github/workflows/` — CI, plus the `@claude` implementer and review agents.

## The task interface

**Do your work through mise tasks, not ad-hoc shell commands.** The tasks in
`mise.toml` are the supported set of operations for both developers and agents.

```
mise tasks          # list available tasks
mise run <task>     # run one (install, build, test, format, start, rescript, ci)
mise run format     # format all ReScript source in place
mise run ci         # install → build → test → format-check, exactly what CI runs
```

Tasks wrap the underlying tools (`pnpm`, and framework CLIs like `rescript`),
so running `mise run build` is how you invoke those tools — you don't call them
directly.

### Passing arguments / passthrough tasks

mise forwards anything after `--` to a task's command, and that whole
invocation is still covered by the `Bash(mise run:*)` allowlist. So a single
**passthrough task** can expose a tool's *entire* CLI surface without widening
the Bash allowlist at all. The `rescript` task does this for the ReScript
compiler:

```
mise run rescript -- core build -w     # rescript build -w, in packages/core
mise run rescript -- core format -all  # rescript format -all, in packages/core
```

Prefer this over asking for raw `pnpm`/`npx` access: to reach a new subcommand
of a tool you already have a passthrough for, just pass it after `--`.

### When `mise` isn't installed (sandboxed agents)

This project uses mise as a command runner, but if you're in a claude cloud
sandbox you probably can't install it the normal way. Instead, source
`claude-cloud-dev-env.sh` from the repo root:

```
source claude-cloud-dev-env.sh
```

It installs `mise`, trusts the repo, installs the pinned tools, and activates
them for the current shell — after which `mise tasks` / `mise run ci` work as
normal. This only fixes the current session; wiring it into the environment's
setup script is a human decision, so flag it rather than assuming it.

## Permissions (for CI agents)

The `@claude` GitHub agent runs under a deliberately **tight** allowlist (see
`--allowedTools` in `.github/workflows/claude.yml`):

- Bash is limited to `mise run`, `mise tasks`, `mise install`, and
  `gh pr create`.
- Web access is limited to specific toolchain-docs domains
  (`rescript-lang.org`, `pnpm.io`, `mise.jdx.dev`) via domain-scoped
  `WebFetch`. There is no open web or `WebSearch`.

This is intentional. When you need a capability you don't have, **widen the
interface, not the allowlist**:

- **Need a new operation** (format, codegen, scaffold, lint, …)? Add a
  `mise` task for it and call it via `mise run`. Prefer this over requesting
  raw `pnpm`/`npx`/shell access. To expose a tool's *whole* CLI in one task,
  make it a passthrough (see “Passing arguments” above).
- **Need docs from another domain**? Add a specific
  `WebFetch(domain:<host>)` entry to the workflow — not blanket `WebFetch`.
- **Need something you genuinely can't express as a task or grant yourself?**
  Say so in your PR/comment so a human can decide, and proceed as best you can
  (following the framework's documented conventions) in the meantime.

Keep the review workflow (`claude-code-review.yml`) and the implementer
workflow (`claude.yml`) consistent with this model.

## Pull request lifecycle

When resolving an issue, once the requirements are clearly met and the test
suite is green (`mise run ci`), **open a pull request** rather than reporting
back on the issue. Don't wait to be asked a second time.

- Push your branch and open the PR with `gh pr create`, linking the issue it
  closes.
- Move any remaining discussion, follow-ups, or review to the PR — the issue
  thread is done once the PR exists.
- If the requirements are genuinely ambiguous or CI can't be made green, say so
  on the issue instead of opening a PR, and explain what's blocking.

## Filing issues

Issues here are **short by design**. When you open one — or help draft one —
capture just enough for someone to pick the work up later: a paragraph or two
of context and a few bullets. Aim well under ~200 words; a two-line issue is
fine (see #199, #201).

- **Lead with the outcome** — what should exist or change, and why it matters.
  Then bullets for scope, acceptance criteria, or reproduction steps.
- **Leave the analysis behind.** The discussion that produced the issue stays
  in the conversation or PR; don't transcribe it. If the "why" is one line, one
  line is enough. (Contrast the 500–1000-word essays of the early issues — not
  the target.)
- **Link, don't restate.** Reference related issues/PRs by number instead of
  recapping them.

Label issues so they stay findable. The taxonomy is deliberately small:

- `bug` — a defect. **Its absence means "some other work"** — there is no
  catch-all not-a-bug label, and that's intentional; don't add one.
- `TUI` / `PWA` — area tags for the terminal (`packages/cli`) and web
  (`packages/web-app`) frontends. Apply when an issue clearly belongs to one.
  Work in `packages/core` carries no area tag today.
- `tracking` — an umbrella issue coordinating several child issues (e.g. a
  multi-part effort with a task list linking the pieces). Use it instead of the
  ad-hoc `[FUTURE]`-style title prefixes.

Apply these when filing on a maintainer's behalf; reach for a label that isn't
listed here only if they ask.

## Formatting

Code is formatted by ReScript's own formatter. **Run `mise run format` before
committing** so your changes match the canonical style. CI enforces this: the
`ci` task runs `format-check`, which fails if any file would be reformatted, so
an unformatted file will turn the build red.

Developers get format-on-save automatically via the workspace settings in
`.vscode/` (install the recommended ReScript extension when VS Code prompts).

## Conventions

- Prefer a framework's own CLI (invoked through a mise task) over hand-writing
  files it would generate.
- Keep code formatted — run `mise run format` (or rely on format-on-save)
  before committing; CI's `format-check` rejects unformatted code.
- Consult the latest official docs (allowed domains above) rather than relying
  on memory for framework specifics.
- Leave the `hello` / `hello-cli` example packages in place for now; they exist
  to exercise CI and the agents.
