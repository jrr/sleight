// A tiny CLI over the modelled games (#62), now also a *reducer driver* (#84):
// it can deal a game and dispatch moves into the same `core` reducer the web app
// uses, printing the resulting board — a headless, scriptable way to exercise the
// rules end to end. Still a conventional scrolling CLI, not a TUI.
//
//   cli show <game>   Draw a game's opening layout (one-shot; see Render)
//   cli list          List the available games
//   cli play [game]   Drive the reducer: read commands from stdin, print boards
//   cli               Greeting + usage
//
// `play` is *batch* mode, not a live REPL: it reads all of stdin to EOF, folds
// the whole script through the pure `Repl` interpreter (deal / move / print / …),
// and prints the transcript at once — nothing is echoed until the stream closes.
// So it's driven by piping a script
//   printf 'deal stacking\nmove AS 0\nprint\n' | cli play
//   cli play < packages/cli/examples/stacking-run.txt
// or by typing commands and pressing Ctrl-D (still batch — no per-line prompt).
// An optional [game] argument deals that game first, so `cli play stacking` opens
// straight onto the board. See packages/cli/README.md and examples/ for more.
