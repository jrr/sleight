// The reducer driver, as a *pure* command interpreter (#84). This is the CLI's
// brain: it holds a `GameState.t` and folds text commands into the very same
// `core` reducer the web app dispatches into — dealing a game, moving a card,
// printing the board — with no stdin/stdout or pointer plumbing of its own. That
// keeps the whole loop headless and scriptable: `Cli.res` wires it to a terminal
// (see there), while tests drive `run` over a canned script and assert the echo.
//
// The command surface, deliberately small and leaving room for `undo` (#-next):
//   deal <game>          start (or restart) a game — GameState.initial
//   move <card> <pile>   dispatch a Move onto pile <index>, printing the result
//   move <card> table    dispatch a Move loose onto the table (free games only)
//   print                re-print the current board
//   games                list the available games
//   help                 show this command surface
//
// A card is addressed by its compact identity (`AS`, `TH`, `KD` — see
// `CardText`), a pile by its index, and the table by the word `table`.
//
// A line whose first non-space character is `#` is a comment: it's skipped
// entirely (not echoed, not run), so a piped script can document itself — see
// `packages/cli/examples/`. Blank lines are skipped too.
