// A *game* modelled as data: a board's rules, independent of any presentation.
// This is the first step of "several supported games" (#62) — the card-stacking
// demo, described declaratively so the view can interpret it dynamically instead
// of hard-coding zones and an opening deal. A new game is a new value here, not
// new view code.
//
// What a game says:
//   - `piles` — the drop zones, each with a stacking behaviour (how a second
//     card lands on the first) *and* the rule it enforces (what it will accept).
//     The model says how many there are, how each stacks, and the law each
//     obeys; where they sit on screen is the view's business.
//   - each pile's `rule` — the stackability law as data (#76): may a card land
//     on this pile given its current top card? A `Rules.rule` value weighed by
//     the pure `Rules.accepts`, shared by the view's hover highlight and its
//     drop decision. Because the rule lives on the *pile*, one board can carry
//     piles of different kinds — a #75 alternating-colour tableau and a
//     same-suit foundation — side by side (see `foundations`).
//   - `free`  — may a card be dropped loose on the table, outside any pile?
//     When `false`, a card released off a pile snaps back to where it came from,
//     so cards only ever rest in piles (#63).
//   - `loose` — the opening deal: specific cards resting free on the table.
//     A pile can also open holding cards (`pile.cards`), so a non-free game can
//     start with everything already stacked.
//   - `caption` — optional prose the view shows beneath the board, describing
//     how this particular game plays. `None` means no caption.
//
// The view (`TableScene`) reads all of this and lays the board out on its own
// terms — "piles hang from the top of the stage and grow downward".

open Card

// How a newcomer lands on a pile that already holds a card (#56): `Squared`
// covers the last card so the pile keeps a single card's footprint; `Fanned`
// steps off it so every card keeps a visible edge.

// One drop zone: its stacking behaviour (layout — how a second card lands
// visually), the `rule` it enforces (what it will accept — #76), an optional
// `capacity` (how many cards it may hold — #93), and the cards it opens holding
// (bottom-first, so the last is the top of the pile).
//
// `capacity` is `None` for the unbounded piles (cascades, foundations) and
// `Some(n)` for a capped one — a FreeCell **free cell** is `Rules.Free` with
// `Some(1)`, a pile that holds exactly one card of any suit. The cap depends on
// the pile's *current count*, which `Rules.accepts` deliberately never sees, so
// it's enforced one layer up in `Reducer.canDrop`/`reduce` — `Rules.accepts`
// stays purely about ordering/colour/rank.
