// The missing middle of the reduxey loop (#82): an `action` variant and a pure
// `reduce` that transitions the immutable `GameState.t` (#77) and enforces the
// stacking rules (#76). This is the ROADMAP's load-bearing principle made real —
// "immutable state + action variant + pure reducer, illegal actions rejected."
//
// Deliberately still *no view changes*: nothing dispatches yet. This is the
// transition function plus its tests, so the later drivers (the view cutover and
// the CLI) have something to dispatch into. The view keeps its own mutable refs
// for now.
//
// The shapes:
//   - `Game.t` is the *board definition* — each pile's `rule` and the game's
//     `free` flag. Static across a game.
//   - `GameState.t` is the *dynamic* snapshot — where each card rests. It
//     deliberately carries no rules, so the reducer must be handed the `game`
//     too: it closes over both, `reduce(~game, state, action)`.
//   - `result<GameState.t, moveError>` makes rejection explicit, so a driver can
//     tell a *rejected* move (bounce back / red flash) from a legal no-op —
//     unlike a `state => state` reducer that would swallow both.
