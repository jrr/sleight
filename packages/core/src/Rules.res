// Stackability rules: whether a candidate card may land on a pile, decided by a
// single *pure* predicate over card identities. This is Step 1 of the
// roadmap-to-M1 sketch (#75): the decision is a standalone function rather than
// logic inlined in the pointer/drop handler, even though the game state is still
// view-owned for now.
//
// Keeping it here — pure and free of any view or DOM concern — means the later
// M1 migration relocates it into a reducer (`Rules.canDrop`) instead of
// rewriting it, and it is unit-testable immediately (see `Core_test`). Each pile
// carries the `rule` it enforces (`Game.pile.rule`); the view's hover highlight
// and its drop-accept/reject decision call `accepts` with that rule, so the
// green "valid" outline and the accepted drop can never disagree.
//
// #76 generalises #75's single hard-coded rule into *data* — a `rule` per pile —
// so one board can carry piles that stack by different laws (a #75 alternating
// tableau and a same-suit foundation) with no rule-specific code path: both are
// values of the same `rule` type, weighed by the same `accepts`.
