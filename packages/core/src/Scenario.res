// Named *starting scenarios* — canned `GameState.t` snapshots a driver can force
// a board into, instead of always opening from the deal. The web-app selects one
// by name from a URL query parameter (see the web-app's `AppUrl`), which is how
// the screenshot report captures a *mid-game* FreeCell without having to play the
// board interactively first.
//
// A scenario is just a pure function `Game.t => GameState.t`: it lives in `core`
// alongside the state it builds, stays deterministic (seeded, no `Math.random`),
// and is exercised by the same reducer/queries as any other state. Nothing here
// is a new game — these are *positions* within the existing boards.

open Card

// A plausible **mid-game FreeCell** snapshot, derived from the seeded deal so the
// 52-card invariant (every card exactly once) holds by construction: cards are
// only ever *moved* out of the shuffled deck, never invented. It's not the result
// of playing a specific line — it doesn't need to be, the point is a representative
// *layout* — but every pile is a shape a real game reaches: foundations part-built
// up by suit, a couple of free cells occupied, the rest spread across the cascades.
//
//   - Foundations: an ascending Ace-up run per suit, at uneven heights (one suit
//     still untouched) so the top row reads as a game in progress rather than a
//     fresh or finished board.
//   - Free cells: two of the four occupied, two empty.
//   - Cascades: everything left, dealt round-robin across the board's cascades.
//
// Distributed by *role* over the board it's handed, so the snapshot lines up with
// however that board orders its piles (FreeCell puts cells and foundations before
// the cascades — see `Game.freecellDeal`).
