// Tests for the named starting scenarios (Scenario.res). The scenarios feed the
// screenshot report a fixed mid-game position, so the load-bearing guarantee is
// that the position is *well-formed* — it holds a full deck (no card invented,
// dropped or duplicated) and lays out onto the board's roles the way the report
// expects (part-built foundations, a couple of occupied cells, the rest in the
// cascades). These lock that in so a future tweak to the heights or the deal can't
// silently produce a broken board.
