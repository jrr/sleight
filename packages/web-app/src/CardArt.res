// The card SVG generator: a `Deck.card` in, an inline `<svg>` vnode out. Like
// SvgScene, these are typed vnodes rendered by the hand-rolled `Html` runtime —
// never `innerHTML` strings — so a card is an ordinary node the reconciler can
// diff and patch.
//
// This is the rudimentary first cut called for by #36: a rounded-rect frame,
// the rank character in two opposite corners (the bottom-right one rotated 180°
// so the card reads the same either way up), and one suit symbol in the middle.
// No pip grids and no court illustrations — those are follow-ups.
//
// The `~detail` parameter exists from day one even though `Full` is its only
// level. It's the hook for the later information-density variant (LOD): a second
// level will drop detail on small cards, chosen by rendered size. Until then
// every card renders `Full`.

type detail = Full

// The card face geometry, shared by every card. A 120×168 viewBox keeps the
// familiar 5:7 playing-card ratio; CSS sizes the rendered card responsively.
let viewBox = "0 0 120 168"

// The card face *contents* — everything inside the `viewBox`, with no `<svg>`
// wrapper. Kept separate from `svg` so the same drawing can be nested inside
// another SVG (e.g. the app icon composes a fan of these), which is what keeps
// the icon in step with the card design: it reuses this exact body.
let body = (~detail=Full, card: Deck.card) => {
  // Only one detail level today; naming it keeps the switch exhaustive so adding
  // a second level later is a compile error until it's handled everywhere.
  let Full = detail

  // Corner rank glyph. The top-left one uses these coordinates as-is; the
  // bottom-right one reuses the exact same node but rotates the whole thing 180°
  // about the card's center (60, 84), which maps top-left to bottom-right and
  // flips it upside down — so the two corners are always mirror images.
