// The drag-and-drop tech demo (#21): a few cards you can drag freely with a
// pointer, and a row of drop zones they snap into when released over one. It's a
// throwaway spike to learn pointer-based dragging in isolation — no game logic,
// no card model beyond the local `Deck` the gallery already uses.
//
// Dragging is transient *view* state (where a finger is right now), so unlike
// the other scenes this one is built with plain imperative DOM bindings rather
// than the `Html` Elm loop — a pointermove doesn't belong in a reduced model,
// and driving the card straight from the event keeps it glued to the finger.
// The card faces themselves are still typed `CardArt` vnodes, materialised once
// with `Html.create` and then moved around by mutating `style.left/top`.
//
// The mechanics the demo is here to exercise:
//   - Pointer Events (`pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup`) instead of mouse
//     + touch, so one code path covers phone and desktop.
//   - `setPointerCapture`, so a card keeps receiving moves even when the pointer
//     outruns it and leaves its bounds mid-drag.
//   - `touch-action: none` (in CSS) on the cards, so a drag doesn't also scroll
//     or trigger a browser gesture on touch.
//   - Hit-testing the card's centre against each zone's rect to pick a drop
//     target, and snapping the card to that zone's centre on release.

// --- Pointer / geometry bindings ---------------------------------------------

// (coordinates + id), so bind a pointer-specific listener and the few reads off
// the event and the element that the maths below wants.

// --- Stacking behaviours (#56) -----------------------------------------------
// What happens when you drop a second card onto a zone that already holds one?
// The demo names and contrasts the two piling behaviours you see in a real
// card game:
//   - Squared: the newcomer lands squarely on top of the last, covering it.
//     The pile keeps a single card's footprint — a squared-up draw/waste pile.
//   - Fanned: each card steps off the one beneath so every card keeps a visible
//     edge, the staggered look of an in-progress solitaire tableau.

// A zone and a card reference each other — the zone owns the ordered pile of
// cards resting in it, and each card knows which zone is its `home` — so the
// two types are mutually recursive.
//
// The pile is the *source of truth* for stacking: a card's slot is simply its
// index in the pile, and the top card is the last element. Because only the
// top card is draggable (below), a pile behaves like a stack — cards are only
// ever pushed onto or popped off the top — so the slots of the survivors stay
// contiguous and the Fanned offsets reflow (and reset) instead of a raw count
// that only ever grew.
