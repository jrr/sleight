// Web-app entry point. The *chrome* — the version badge and the "Update
// available" button that frame the scene, plus the scene picker itself — is
// expressed as ReScript JSX on the hand-rolled `Html` runtime and driven by its
// Elm-style loop, rather than the imperative createElement/setAttribute dance
// this file used to be. (The greeting and tagline are no longer permanent chrome
// at all: they've moved into their own HomeScene, shown only when "Home" is the
// selected scene — see issue #59.) The only dynamic bits of the chrome (offline-ready
// and update-available, both reported by the service worker) live in the model;
// the service-worker callbacks just `dispatch` a message and the view re-renders
// itself. The scene area underneath — the switcher and its demos — is still the
// imperative SceneSwitcher; it's spliced into the view untouched with
// `Html.node`, which is exactly how a JSX chrome wraps a subtree it doesn't own.

// --- Service-worker registration (vite-plugin-pwa virtual module) -----------
// `registerSW` registers the worker (with a relative URL, so its scope follows
// the GitHub Pages subpath) and returns an `updateSW(reloadPage)` function that
// tells the waiting worker to skip waiting and then reloads the page.

// --- Chrome components -------------------------------------------------------
// The two capitalized components used by the view below — `<VersionBadge/>` and
// `<UpdateButton/>` — live in their own files under `src/components/`. Each is a
// `props => vnode` function; capitalized JSX lowers `<VersionBadge .../>` to
// `Html.jsx(VersionBadge.make, props)`, filling the module's `props` record from
// the attributes. See those files for why the record is spelled out by hand
// instead of derived by the `@jsx.component` sugar.

// --- The Elm loop ------------------------------------------------------------
// The chrome is a pure model + update + view. Everything reactive here is
// service-worker lifecycle: the two booleans flip when their callbacks fire.

// only the scene. See SceneSwitcher / Scene.
// The scene list ends with one scene per *modelled game* (#62): `Game.all` is
// the source of truth, and `TableScene.make` interprets each game's rules, so a
// new game is a new value in core — no new scene code, no edit here.
//
// The URL can steer both which scene opens (`?scene=`) and which starting
// position it opens in (`?state=`): each game scene is built with the scenario the
// URL names for it (via `Scenario.forName`), or its ordinary deal when there's
// none, and the named scene is forced open below. That's the whole entry point the
// screenshot report drives (`?scene=freecell&state=midgame`).
