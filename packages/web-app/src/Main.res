// Web-app entry point. The app *opens as a game*: on startup it mounts the
// FreeCell board straight away (#109), and all the chrome — a single top bar plus
// a slide-over menu — is expressed as ReScript JSX on the hand-rolled `Html`
// runtime and driven by its Elm-style loop. The bottom of the screen is left
// clear for dragging cards; every control lives up top.
//
// The chrome is two components over the scene:
//   - `<TopBar>` — Menu · Undo · Redo. Always visible across the top; the Menu
//     button carries a green pip when a version update is waiting (#165).
//   - `<Menu>` — the slide-over holding the title ("Pip", moved out of the
//     retired Home scene), a **Game** section (New Game · Restart, #156), the
//     debug/demo scene list as tappable rows, and the About footer (build/version
//     info plus the conditional "Update now" button, #165).
// The scene area underneath is still the imperative `SceneSwitcher`; its scene
// container and its row controls are spliced into the view untouched with
// `Html.node` (the container into the scene band, the rows into the menu), which
// is exactly how a JSX chrome wraps a subtree it doesn't own.

// `<TopBar .../>` to `Html.jsx(TopBar.make, props)`, filling the module's `props`
// record from the attributes. See those files for why the record is spelled out
// by hand instead of derived by the `@jsx.component` sugar.

// --- The Elm loop ------------------------------------------------------------

// lifecycle (two booleans flip when their callbacks fire) and whether the menu is
// open.
