// Persist a player's driver preferences (#139) across sessions in the browser's
// localStorage, so a toggle they flip in the menu is still set on the next launch.
// Only the web app persists preferences — the CLI takes its `Options` per run — so
// this binding lives here rather than in `core`, and it speaks the shared
// `Options.t` (currently just `autoCollect`) so the stored shape tracks the same
// seam both drivers already read.
//
// localStorage access can throw outright (Safari private mode, a sandboxed frame,
// storage disabled), so every touch is guarded: a failure to read falls back to
// the shipped `Options.default` (auto-collect on), and a failure to write is
// swallowed — the preference simply won't persist, which is no worse than having
// no storage at all.
