// A card table that *interprets a modelled game* (`Game.t` from core) rather
// than hard-coding one board. Grown out of the drag-and-drop spike (#21) and the
// stacking demo (#56), and now driven by data (#62): the piles, their stacking
// behaviours and the opening deal all come from the game, so a new game is a new
// value in `Game`, not new code here.
//
// The view holds its own presentation assumptions — the piles hang from the top
// of the stage and grow downward; the loose cards are dealt as a sloppy cluster
// below them — and applies them to whatever the model describes, be it two piles
// or sixteen. The piles are grouped into rows by role (#94/#97): free cells and
// foundations across the top, cascades below, so a full FreeCell board is
// playable; a single-role board (every other demo) is just one row, as before.
//
// Dragging is transient *view* state (where a finger is right now), so unlike
// the other scenes this one is built with plain imperative DOM bindings rather
// than the `Html` Elm loop — a pointermove doesn't belong in a reduced model,
// and driving the card straight from the event keeps it glued to the finger.
// The card faces themselves are still typed `CardArt` vnodes, materialised once
// with `Html.create` and then moved around by mutating `style.left/top`.
//
// The mechanics the demo is here to exercise:
//   - Pointer Events (`pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup`) instead of mouse
//     + touch, so one code path covers phone and desktop.
//   - `setPointerCapture`, so a card keeps receiving moves even when the pointer
//     outruns it and leaves its bounds mid-drag.
//   - `touch-action: none` (in CSS) on the cards, so a drag doesn't also scroll
//     or trigger a browser gesture on touch.
//   - Hit-testing the card's centre against each zone's rect to pick a drop
//     target, and snapping the card to that zone's centre on release.
//   - Squared vs fanned pile layout, reflowed live from the zones' rects.

// --- Pointer / geometry bindings ---------------------------------------------
