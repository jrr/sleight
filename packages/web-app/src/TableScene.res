// A card table that *interprets a modelled game* (`Game.t` from core) rather
// than hard-coding one board. Grown out of the drag-and-drop spike (#21) and the
// stacking demo (#56), and now driven by data (#62): the piles, their stacking
// behaviours and the opening deal all come from the game, so a new game is a new
// value in `Game`, not new code here.
//
// The view holds its own presentation assumptions — the piles hang from the top
// of the stage and grow downward; the loose cards are dealt as a sloppy cluster
// below them — and applies them to whatever the model describes, be it two piles
// or sixteen. The piles are grouped into rows by role (#94/#97): free cells and
// foundations across the top, cascades below, so a full FreeCell board is
// playable; a single-role board (every other demo) is just one row, as before.
//
// Dragging is transient *view* state (where a finger is right now), so unlike
// the other scenes this one is built with plain imperative DOM bindings rather
// than the `Html` Elm loop — a pointermove doesn't belong in a reduced model,
// and driving the card straight from the event keeps it glued to the finger.
// The card faces themselves are still typed `CardArt` vnodes, materialised once
// with `Html.create` and then moved around by mutating `style.left/top`.
//
// The mechanics the demo is here to exercise:
//   - Pointer Events (`pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup`) instead of mouse
//     + touch, so one code path covers phone and desktop.
//   - `setPointerCapture`, so a card keeps receiving moves even when the pointer
//     outruns it and leaves its bounds mid-drag.
//   - `touch-action: none` (in CSS) on the cards, so a drag doesn't also scroll
//     or trigger a browser gesture on touch.
//   - Hit-testing the card's centre against each zone's rect to pick a drop
//     target, and snapping the card to that zone's centre on release.
//   - Squared vs fanned pile layout, reflowed live from the zones' rects.

// --- Pointer / geometry bindings ---------------------------------------------

// Omitted, the board isn't re-dealable (the fixed-layout demos).

// `~publishNewGame` is how the chrome's menu (#156) reaches the re-deal: when
// the board is re-dealable, the scene hands its `buildBoard(freshDeal())` thunk
// to `publishNewGame` on mount, and the menu's New Game button calls it. (The
// New Game control lives in the menu now, not on the board or the top bar.) The
// chrome resets its hook on every scene switch, so a non-re-dealable scene simply
// leaves it unset — it never calls `publishNewGame`.
//
// `~publishRestart` is the sibling re-deal hook that replays the *same* deal (#156):
// the menu's Restart button rebuilds the board from the game currently showing —
// same seed, same opening layout — so a player can start the current deal over
// rather than get a new one. Unlike New Game it's published by *every* card table
// (a fixed-layout demo restarts to its own opening deal), tracking the live game
// through the `currentGame` ref below so a Restart after a New Game replays the
// *new* deal, not the one the scene first mounted with.
// `~options` is a *ref* to the driver preference record (#125), read *live* at
// each post-move step so a menu toggle (#139) that flips a field takes effect on
// the very next move without rebuilding the board. Its `autoCollect` flag (on by
// its `default`) sends every *safe* card home after an accepted move; the app's
// menu owns this ref and rewrites it when the player flips the setting.
//
// `~publishLoadState` is the debug "states" hook (sibling to `~publishNewGame`):
// on mount the scene hands the chrome a `GameState.t => unit` that rebuilds the
// board into any forced position — the same `~initial` path a `?state=` scenario
// takes, but reachable live from the menu instead of only at load. The debug-states
// menu (see `DebugStates` / `Main`) calls it with a `Scenario` snapshot.
//
// `~tiltEnabled` is a *ref* to the hand-placed-tilt preference (#65), read *live*
// wherever a card is laid out so a menu toggle takes hold on the next relayout
// without rebuilding the board — the same live-ref trick as `~options`. When it's
// off, cards rest dead-square. `~publishRelayout` is its companion hook (sibling of
// `~publishNewGame`): on every build the board hands the chrome a thunk that
// re-lays every resting card, so flipping the tilt switch re-tilts (or un-tilts)
// the board in place, immediately, rather than only on the next move.
//
// `~publishUndo` is the undo hook (#85), sibling of `~publishNewGame`: on every
// build the board hands the top bar a thunk that steps its `GameState` history
// back and re-derives the layout. `~onHistory` is the reverse channel — after
// every state change the board calls it with the current `canUndo` so the top bar
// can enable or disable the button. Undo works even from a won board: a victory is
// just another recorded state, so stepping back tears the win overlay down and
// returns to the prior position. (Redo lives on in `core`'s `History` for the CLI,
