// The Settings screen's **Updates** section (#112), lifted out of `Menu` into its
// own pure component so its states can be exercised in isolation (#201). It's the
// adaptive refresh button whose `label` and `onClick` adapt to whether a service
// worker is registered (see Refresh/Main).
//
// **The size story (#201).** This section used to carry a transient status line
// *under* the button ("Checking…", "Up to date") that appeared and disappeared,
// growing and shrinking the section — a visible reflow of everything below it. The
// status line is gone: progress now shows as a **spinner on the button itself**
// (`busy`), which lives inside the button's own line and so changes nothing about
// the section's height. With no line to come and go, the section is heading +
// button in every state — trivially size-stable. `RefreshControl_test` pins that:
// the section's rows are the same whether or not a check is running.
//
// A component is just a `props => vnode` function (see `VersionBadge` for why the
// record is spelled out by hand). The whole section is optional at the *call* site
// — `Menu` shows it only once a worker state is known.
type props = {
  label: string,
  // An update check / refresh is in flight — spin the on-button indicator. The
  // action itself is quick, so there's no separate result text: an update that's
  // found surfaces as the About footer's Update button, and the spinner simply
  // stops otherwise.
